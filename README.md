</h1>
<p align="center">
	A project that scrapes a bunch of Solana tokens for the top 100 traders, dumps them into JSON then checks wallet data such as realised and unrealized gains through GMGN API.</br>
</p>

```
1. Install required libraries - pip install requirements.txt
2. Load your tokens into tokens.txt
3. Run main.py to grab the top trader data from the tokens
4. Run pnlCheck.py to get the profit data on those top trader wallets
```
